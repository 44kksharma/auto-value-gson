# AutoValue: Gson Extension

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-gson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-gson)

An extension for Google's [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto) that creates a simple [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) TypeAdapterFactory for each AutoValue annotated object.

**Note**: This is a very early version that won't work with the released AutoValue until a [PR](https://github.com/google/auto/pull/237) has been merged.

## Usage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-gson.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-gson)

Simply include AutoGson in your project and add the generated Serializer and Deserializer as a TypeAdapter.  You can also annotate your properties using `@SerializedName` to define an alternate name for de/serialization.

```java
import com.ryanharter.auto.value.gson.SerializedName;

@AutoValue public abstract class Foo {
  abstract String bar();
  @SerializedName("Baz") abstract String baz();

  public static TypeAdapterFactory typeAdapterFactory() {
    return AutoValue_Foo.typeAdapterFactory();
  }
}

final Gson gson = new GsonBuilder()
  .registerTypeAdapterFactory(Foo.class, Foo.typeAdapterFactory())
  .create();
```

**Note**: Since Gson's built in SerializedName annotation can't be used on methods, you'll have to change your `SerializedName` import to `com.ryanharter.auto.value.gson.SerializedName`.

Now build your project and de/serialize your Foo.

## TODO

This wouldn't be quite complete without some added features.

* Automatic registration
* Default value support

## Download
